# MLOps_Project_Pankhil: Language Translation using Transformer 
Pankhil Gawade 

##  Overall goal of the project 
The goal of this Project is to use the Transformer-Pytorch framework to solve the problem of language translation e.g. (en-it).

## Framework used and inclusion 
We plan to use the Transformer framework for this problem since it is the most obvious choice -DUH!
Since transformers provide thousands of pre-trained models to perform different tasks. As a starting point, we intend to use some of the pre-trained models on our data and improve further.

## Initial Data 
We plan on using the [OPUS Books](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opus_books) dataset to translate English text to Italian. Each sample in the train and test set has the following information: a unique identifier(ID) and translation which includes a sentence in English and its translation in Italian.

## Deep Learning Models used

We plan to use pre-trained models. Since we are working on a translation task one of the models we plan to use is OPUS-MT-en-it.
